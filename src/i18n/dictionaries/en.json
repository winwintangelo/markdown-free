      "answer": "We don't use advertising trackers, sell your data, or track you across websites. We use privacy-respecting analytics but never log file contents or personal information."

      "question": "Is the conversion secure?",
      "answer": "Yes. All connections use HTTPS. Markdown preview renders client-side. PDF generation is server-side but content is never persisted. All HTML is XSS-sanitized."
